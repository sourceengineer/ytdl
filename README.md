Just a small thing. No flexibillity.

``` How to use it.
Run "npm install".
Create a folder called "downloads"

run it with "node index.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDcaIaLgvqk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDcaIaLgvqk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDcaIaLgvqk"
just chain Youtube links behing it.
```
As long as they start with "http" and are a valid link it's working fine.
If you want anything special, just change it in the code, this was just a handy tool for myself
